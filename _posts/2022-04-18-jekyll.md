title: Using Jekyll, Selenium, and Lighthouse CI #layouts are defaulted to weblogs (see _config.yml)

This page was rendered using Jekyll! 

I'm currently writing this in plain markdown, and Jekyll is compiling this into formatted html for me! 
Also, every time I push to my repository, I have a Selenium script that informs me of any broken links on my blog, and a Lighthouse CI script that informs me of how my website does in terms of "best practices".

Needless to say, I'm very impressed with how this minimalist website turned out. 

If you have any questions on how I created the website along with the CI, feel free to reach out, or fork my repository.
